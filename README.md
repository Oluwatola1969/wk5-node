## NODE.JS SANDBOX
This Node.js Sandbox provides a simple environment for experimenting with core Node.js functionalities, including:

- Creating HTTP servers
- Handling file operations using the `fs` module (promise-based)


### 1. **HTTP Server**
The sandbox allows you to create and run a basic HTTP server using Node.js. You'll be able to:
- Serve responses to HTTP requests.
- Use different content types for responses.

### 2. **File Operations with `fs/promises`**
Explore asynchronous file system operations using the promise-based version of the `fs` module. This includes:
- Reading files
- Handling errors during file operations
